# Arduino Work for N SLASH A - LIVE 20XX


A few years back I decided I wanted to create a live music show that functioned similar to an art installation. I'd been playing live music for years, and I was bored, looking for something fresh. So I chellenged myself to design a show that would be part theater, part performance art, and be something that would be completely controlled by myself, live.

I envisioned that the show would take place in a gallery or other type of live space. Many venues I've played in over the years have been far from ideal for the kind of music produciton that I like to create, so while acoustically a large echo chamber of a gallery may present problems, the greater resolve of the partons in that scene being there to see ART, not just DRINK, would outweigh the theoretical cons of such a space, and allow me access to the kind of patrons I really wanted to play for anyways.

And it would look something like this:<br>

I wrote a short story that the set would revolve around, tentatively titled "the Mirror". It revolved around a single person, who for whatever reason was working with an AI they had created inside a small underground laboratory in order to help them understand what had happened to the human race, as no other living being could be located on the surface, and the reasoning for their dissapearance was not clear. The AI would guide the person along their understanding of the events that had unfolded and led to the demise of humanity, and the music would function as "stories" that the AI would tell to the user as part of their interaction.

To support this story, the live show would be designed to feel like a laboratory, where large LED screens would be used as the interface with the AI, but also as lighting and story telling elements.

In order for this to work, I'd need to design and build out LED screens that could handle this story telling.

Typically at a live show these days, LED screens are static, or at best they move up and down on chain motors. I wanted to develop something that was more mobile, more visceral, and being inspired by the "Box" film by Bot & Dolly, I came up with something that works like a camera dolly to traverse the stage, and rotates/pivots on Y and Z axis:

This would allow not only some interesting stage movement, but ways to utilize the screens in more than just "playing live video". they could be used as lighting elements, or placed relative to the stage player (in this case, me) for dramatic or theatrical effect.

The only thing left was to build it. Thats where Arduino comes in. My aim is to eventually control it with Ableton Live/Max 4 live. For now, I'm just learning the circuits, but the programming to handle this is much simpler than the prototyping of the physical hardware. Heres a shot of the two prototypes in my studio:

I have a ways to go, but its a passion project and I'll contiue to work on it as I have time. As I do, my work and progress will be available to see here.



More soon...
